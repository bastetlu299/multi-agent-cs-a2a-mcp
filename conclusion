This project deepened my understanding of how MCP and A2A fit together to build reliable multi-agent systems. By exposing database operations through an MCP JSON-RPC server (tools/list, tools/call) and consuming those tools from independent agents (Router, Customer Data, Support) with clear A2A interfaces, I saw the benefits of separation of concerns: the data layer remains testable via MCP Inspector, while coordination logic lives in agents that can be extended without touching the backend. Implementing both the sequential pattern (predictable, auditable pipelines) and the router pattern (intent-based routing) clarified when to prefer determinism versus flexibility, and how to preserve state hand-offs with structured messages and logs.

The main challenges were operational and debugging-focused. Strict JSON-RPC validation and Inspector inputSchema requirements surfaced easily missed mistakes; network issues (port conflicts, proxies, timeouts) required health checks, backoff/retry, and explicit error codes to make failures observable. Preventing coordination loops and meeting latency targets pushed me to add iteration caps, timeouts, lightweight caching, and selective parallelism. Overall, this was a realistic end-to-end exercise—from protocol-level tool design to multi-agent orchestration and black-box validation with MCP Inspector—that I can reuse in production-style agent systems. This has been the most grueling and painful assignment I’ve done in this project so far
